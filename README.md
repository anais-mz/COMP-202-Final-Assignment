# COMP-202-Final-Assignment

This was the final assignment for my COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming Class. For this, we were given CO2 emission data for different countries over 
the past 267 years. We were required to perform "data cleaning" to then perform emperical analyses on the information. Data cleaning refers to the process of taking raw data and processing it into a state where it can be used for analyses. 

The files we were given with the CO2 emission data has not been included in this repository. They can be added upon request.
