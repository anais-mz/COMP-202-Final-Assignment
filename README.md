# COMP-202-Final-Assignment

This was the final assignment for my COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming Class. For this, we were given CO2 emission data for different countries over 
the past 267 years. We were required to perform "data cleaning" to then perform emperical analyses on the information. 

The files we were given with the CO2 emission data has not been included in this repository. They can be added upon request.
